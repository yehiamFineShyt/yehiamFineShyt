/*what we need:
    1.light box
    2.struct: header,main,footer
    moudle : type = "module" 
    export default: for classes
    export : the rest
    header:
        country names - dflex
        search bar - dflex

    main:
        main page:
            home with 5 countries images as grid 
        img = country image -> img
        img info = float right to img
        leaflet api -> looks like an img but api
        state with boarders: -> str
            the countries that has boradres with the country we pull
        
*image = flags.png
    popilation = population
    name = name.common
    shortcut = cca3
    currency = currencies.ILS.name
    region = region
    capital = capital[0]
    borders is array we need all of it but ps
    

    current plan:
        get all .light-box-inside content unorgainized first
        then organize a good form not the other way around.
